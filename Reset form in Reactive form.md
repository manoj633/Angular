#### Overview
In Angular's reactive forms, the `reset` method is used to reset the values of a form control or form group to their initial state. This method is particularly useful for scenarios such as after form submission or when you want to clear the form fields to allow the user to start over.

#### Purpose of Reset Method
- **Clear Form Values**: Resets the values of the form controls to either `null` or a specified initial value.
- **Reset Form State**: Resets the state of the form including its `dirty`, `touched`, and `pristine` states, making the form appear as if it has never been interacted with.

#### Basic Example
Let's consider a simple form with fields for `firstName` and `lastName` to demonstrate how to use the `reset` method.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormGroup, FormControl } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user-form',
  templateUrl: './user-form.component.html'
})
export class UserFormComponent {
  userForm = new FormGroup({
    firstName: new FormControl(''),
    lastName: new FormControl('')
  });

  resetForm() {
    this.userForm.reset({
      firstName: 'Default First Name',
      lastName: 'Default Last Name'
    });
  }
}
```

#### HTML Template
```html
<!-- user-form.component.html -->
<form [formGroup]="userForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <div>
    <label>First Name:</label>
    <input type="text" formControlName="firstName">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label>Last Name:</label>
    <input type="text" formControlName="lastName">
  </div>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  <button type="button" (click)="resetForm()">Reset</button>
</form>
```

#### Explanation
- **resetForm Method**: This method uses the `reset` function to reset the form values to specified default values. You can also call `reset()` without parameters to set all form controls to `null`.
- **Form Submission**: Typically, you might call the `reset` method after a form submission to clear the form. This example includes a reset button for demonstration purposes.

#### Summary
The `reset` method in Angular's reactive forms is a powerful tool for managing the state of forms. It not only clears the values but also resets the form's meta state like `dirty` and `touched`. This functionality is essential for scenarios where the form needs to be reused or cleared after certain interactions, providing a clean slate for the user.
