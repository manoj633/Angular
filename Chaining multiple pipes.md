Chaining pipes in Angular allows you to apply multiple transformations to a piece of data sequentially. This feature is particularly useful when you need to format or process data in several steps before displaying it in the UI.

#### How to Chain Pipes
To chain pipes, you simply place them one after the other separated by the pipe symbol (`|`). Each pipe takes the output of the previous pipe as its input.

#### Example of Chaining Pipes
Consider a scenario where you need to display a date in uppercase and also format it as a full date. You can achieve this by chaining the `date` pipe with the `uppercase` pipe.

```html
{{ myDate | date:'fullDate' | uppercase }}
```
In this example:
- `myDate` is the original date object.
- The `date` pipe formats `myDate` as a full date string.
- The `uppercase` pipe then converts the formatted date string to uppercase.

Example output might be: "THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2023"

#### Practical Use Case
Chaining pipes is particularly useful in complex data transformations directly within templates, which helps in keeping the component code clean and focused on logic rather than data formatting.

This technique demonstrates the flexibility and power of Angular's templating system, allowing developers to easily combine existing pipes to create more specific formatting and transformation sequences without the need for additional custom pipe creation.
