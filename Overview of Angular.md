## What is Angular?
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google and is widely used for creating dynamic web applications.

## Key Features
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular applications are built using components, which are the fundamental building blocks.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Synchronizes data between the model and the view, allowing for automatic updates.
- **Dependency Injection**: Facilitates the development of modular services and increases code reusability.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom attributes and elements to enhance functionality.
- **Services and Dependency Injection**: Promote code modularity and reusability by allowing components to share data and functionality.
- **Routing**: Built-in support for client-side navigation and deep linking.
- **Observables and RxJS**: Use of reactive programming to handle asynchronous data streams.
- **Forms**: Support for both template-driven and reactive forms for handling user input.
- **Testing**: Tools and utilities for unit testing and end-to-end testing.

## Angular Versions
Angular has undergone significant changes since its initial release. The major versions include:
- **AngularJS (1.x)**: The original version, which is now considered legacy.
- **Angular (2+)**: A complete rewrite of AngularJS, offering improved performance and a more modern architecture.

## Use Cases
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Angular is ideal for building SPAs that require dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
- **Enterprise Web Applications**: Its robust architecture and scalability make it suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: Angular supports building PWAs that offer offline capabilities and enhanced performance.

## Getting Started
To start using Angular, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can then use the Angular CLI to set up a new project:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-angular-app
cd my-angular-app
ng serve
```
