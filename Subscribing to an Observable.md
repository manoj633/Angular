To subscribe to an Observable and use the emitted data in [Angular](https://angular.io/), you can follow these steps. Observables are a key part of Angular's reactive programming model, allowing you to handle asynchronous data streams effectively.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create or Obtain an Observable**: You can create an Observable using [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) or obtain it from a service or other source.

2. **Subscribe to the Observable**: Use the `subscribe` method to listen for data emitted by the Observable.

3. **Handle Emitted Data**: Within the subscription, you can define how to handle the emitted data, errors, and completion.

### Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to subscribe to an Observable and use the emitted data:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <div *ngFor="let item of items">
      {{ item }}
    </div>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  items: string[] = [];

  ngOnInit() {
    // Create an Observable that emits a sequence of values
    const data$: Observable<string[]> = of(['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']);

    // Subscribe to the Observable
    data$.subscribe({
      next: (data) => {
        // Handle emitted data
        this.items = data;
      },
      error: (err) => {
        // Handle error
        console.error('Error occurred:', err);
      },
      complete: () => {
        // Handle completion
        console.log('Observable completed');
      }
    });
  }
}
```

### Key Points

- **`next`**: This function is called whenever the Observable emits a new value. You can update your component's state or perform other actions with the emitted data.
  
- **`error`**: This function is called if the Observable encounters an error. It's a good place to handle any errors that might occur during data emission.

- **`complete`**: This function is called when the Observable completes its data emission. You can perform any cleanup or final actions here.

- **Unsubscribe**: In Angular, it's important to unsubscribe from Observables when the component is destroyed to prevent memory leaks. This can be done manually or by using Angular's `AsyncPipe` in templates or `takeUntil` operator in code.

By following these steps, you can effectively subscribe to Observables and handle the data they emit in your Angular applications.
