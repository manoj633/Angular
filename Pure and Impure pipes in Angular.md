#### Introduction
In Angular, pipes are categorized into two types based on their execution strategy: **Pure** and **Impure** pipes. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring correct data transformations in Angular applications.

#### Pure Pipes
Pure pipes in Angular are pipes that are only executed when Angular detects a change in the input value or the parameters passed to the pipe. These changes are determined by a simple reference check or by comparing primitive data types.

- **Execution**: A pure pipe is executed only when it detects a pure change to the input value(s). This includes changes to primitive input values (like `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`) or object reference changes.
- **Performance**: Since pure pipes are not recalculated unless there is a change in the input, they are generally more performant and are the default choice for most filtering and formatting needs.

##### Example of a Pure Pipe
Here's a simple pure pipe that doubles the input number:
```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'double',
  pure: true
})
export class DoublePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: number): number {
    return value * 2;
  }
}
```
Usage:
```html
{{ 10 | double }}  <!-- Output: 20 -->
```

#### Impure Pipes
Impure pipes, on the other hand, are executed on every change detection cycle, regardless of whether the input has actually changed. This means they can react to changes in deeply nested properties or changes to complex objects like arrays or dates.

- **Execution**: An impure pipe is called during every component view update, making it useful for cases where the pipe needs to process dynamic data that changes frequently.
- **Performance**: Due to their nature, impure pipes can lead to performance issues if not used carefully, as they are recalculated with every change detection cycle.

##### Example of an Impure Pipe
Here's an impure pipe that filters an array of items based on a search term:
```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'filter',
  pure: false
})
export class FilterPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(items: any[], searchTerm: string): any[] {
    if (!items || !searchTerm) {
      return items;
    }
    return items.filter(item => item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()));
  }
}
```
Usage:
```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items | filter:searchTerm">{{ item.name }}</li>
</ul>
```

#### Differences Between Pure and Impure Pipes
1. **Change Detection**:
   - Pure pipes are only executed when Angular detects a change in the input value or parameters.
   - Impure pipes are executed on every change detection cycle, regardless of input changes.

2. **Performance**:
   - Pure pipes are more performant as they are executed less frequently.
   - Impure pipes can lead to performance degradation if not used judiciously due to their frequent execution.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Pure pipes are ideal for simple transformations and formatting that depend on stable inputs.
   - Impure pipes are suitable for handling dynamic content such as live data filtering or updates based on frequent user interactions.

#### Conclusion
Choosing between pure and impure pipes in Angular should be based on the specific needs of the application and the nature of the data being processed. While pure pipes are generally preferred for performance reasons, impure pipes provide necessary functionality for dynamic and complex data transformations.
