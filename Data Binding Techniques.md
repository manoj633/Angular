# Data Binding in Angular

Data binding is a core concept in Angular that allows you to synchronize data between the model and the view. It enables dynamic updates of the UI based on data changes and vice versa.

## Types of Data Binding

### [[String Interpolation]]
- **Syntax**: `{{ expression }}`
- Used to bind data from the component to the view in the form of text.

### [[Property Binding]]
- **Syntax**: `[property]="expression"`
- Binds data from the component to the property of an HTML element.

### [[Event Binding]]
- **Syntax**: `(event)="handler"`
- Allows the view to respond to user actions by binding events to methods in the component.

### [[Two Way Binding]]
- **Syntax**: `[(ngModel)]="property"`
- Combines property and event binding to synchronize data between the model and the view.
